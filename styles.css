The charCodeAt() method returns the Unicode (ASCII for non-special characters) of the character at the specified index in a string.

On the other hand, charAt() method returns the character at the specified index in a string.

For example, if you have a string str = "hello", str.charCodeAt(0) will return 104 which is the ASCII value of h, while str.charAt(0) will simply return the character h.

In your case, you need to use charCodeAt() because you're using the ASCII values as indices for your freq array.
